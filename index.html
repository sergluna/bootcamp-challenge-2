            In this project I wanted to make a random movie selector using
            JavaScript that will choose one movie at random from an array. It
            will then add the selected movie to a watched list.

            In this project I wanted to make a webpage that would request user

            In this project, I work with two class mates to build a web

            some information about the selected film.
